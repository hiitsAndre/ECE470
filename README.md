Team Name: RL Robot
Team Member: Andre He

Project Description: 
Apply (DDPG) Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients to track the nearest exit of a maze. Each training/testing case has a randomly generated maze with multiple exits and a single starting point. Specific algorithms and references will be updated below.

Simulation:
V-REP PRO EDU/Webots. V-REP is used on my Macbook in lab because it is small, versatile, and relatively easy to use. 
Webots is used on my Desktop computer when programming at home.

File Folders and Files will be updated.
